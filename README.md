  <p>âœ¨ Smarter GitHub notifications ðŸŒ±</p>
</div>

## Getting started

Just visit https://meteorite.surge.sh, log in, and let the notifications roll in as they happen!

## How it works

It's actually pretty simple - we use GitHub's notifications API to get your notifications as they come in, and keep track of relevant heuristics overtime on a per-thread basis, so we know _why_ you're getting a notification and the previous reason's you've gotten it.

Using this information, we're able to give a score of importantce to each thread based on the history of reasons we saw coming in. For example, a pull request that is assigned to you, has your review requested, and has 30 comments on it, will be scored much higher than an issue you opened up and received a single comment of someone saying "nice" on it.

We're also able to hook into desktop notifications to alert you when you get a GitHub notification if you'd want - something like this is totally opt-in.

Some key features include:

 - Scores your notifications based on their importance, so we can surface the most critical updates at the top of your queue.
 - Provides you with quick context for why you're receiving each notification.
 - Allows you to opt in for desktop notifications whenever you recieve important update to help notify you right away.
 - Protects you from useless spammy notifications that you don't care about.
 - Let's you focus in on specific types of notifications that matter to you, like when your review is requested for a pull request or you were assigned an issue.
 - Unlocks dope statistics that help you understand how you interact with notifications on a daily basis.

We're also able to categorize some types of notifications and put a badge on them to help you quickly identify different kinds of issues. We support:

 - Old pull requests that require your review (icon is a green clock).
 - Very active threads that get a lot of updates in a short amount of time (icon is a red flame).
 - Threads that have a lot of comments and conversation on them (icon is a blue word bubble).

All contributions are welcome, even if its just submitting feedback, giving a suggestion, or reporting a bug.
